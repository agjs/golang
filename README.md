# golang

* This is my repository for learning Golang and potentially building a REST API for one of the upcoming projects I have in mind.
* Using Atom & go-plus for writing and building go code

- In order to run the program you must have Golang installed and $GOPATH setup.
- After you setup $GOPATH and put these files to its appropriate workspace, you can simply run them by:
 - go install github.com/agjs/hello
 - $GOPATH/bin/hello
 or
- You can use Atom go-plus combined with build plugin and build it by pressing:
 - alt+cmd+b
